The project was developed from March to June 2015, and the initial participants
were (alphabetically):
- Caparica Gustavo
- Endo Bruno
- Haddad Leonardo
- Kaspar Fabio
- Teles Ricardo
- De La Fuente Albert (coach)
- Fassoni Tiago (client)

From July on, this project will be a community driven project we hope to see you
contributing =)
